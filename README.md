# Image to Audio Encryption
### Semester Project <br/>
This GUI Python program encrypts an image as audio.<br/>
The idea is to keep a private image safe from a bad actor, by sending it as an audio file so the bad actor would consider it as not useful. <br/>
There is an option of setting a decryption key as well. <br/>
Though it is not as secure as it should be, still it was an attempt to make something meaningful.
