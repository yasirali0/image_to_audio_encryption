<br/>

This GUI Python program encrypts an image as audio.<br/>
The idea is to keep a private image safe from a bad actor, by sending it as an audio file so the bad actor would consider it as not useful. <br/>
There is an option of setting a decryption key as well. <br/>
Though it is not as sophisticated and secure as it should be, still it was an attempt to make something meaningful.

<br/>

**Install the required libraries**
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The python program is also converted to ".exe" file. <br/>
This is done so that it can be run on windows without installing Python and other requirements.
